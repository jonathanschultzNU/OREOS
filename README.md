Simulate absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy for tunable molecular systems

Welcome to the Optical REspOnse Simulator (OREOS), the package that allows simulation of the optical response and spectra for tunable molecular systems! 

In distribution 1.0, users of OREO can simulate linear absorption and two-dimensional electronic sspectroscopy (2DES) for the following molecular systems: monomer, Frenkel-exciton (FE) dimer

For all systems, both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom are included and have handles for a wide range of tunability. 

OREOS is created in a way that allows users of all coding levels to interact with the models and tailor them to fit their needs. Since all components of this package are open-sourced, please feel free to venture into the backend functions and modify them to your desire!

If you encounter bugs, have ideas for new functionalities, and/or have made edits to the code that you think should be incorporated to the online package, please feel free to contact me at jonathanschultz2022@u.northwestern.edu. I sincerely hope OREOS has a positive impact on your research and/or teaching/learning needs!
