# Oscillation Associated Spectra

Data processing scripts and functions used in Phonon-induced plasmon-exciton coupling changes probed via oscillation-associated spectra (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5116836). Data fitting script leads an individual through all of the relevant steps to calculate the oscillation associated spectra for a given data set.
